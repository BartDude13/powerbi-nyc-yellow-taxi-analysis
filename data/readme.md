## Dataset

This project uses **NYC Yellow Taxi trip data** provided as part of an educational dataset for data analysis practice.

The dataset contains detailed information about taxi trips in New York City, including pickup and drop-off times, locations, trip distance, passenger count, fares, tips, and total trip amounts.

Due to the size of the dataset and usage restrictions, the raw data files are not included in this repository.

The analysis and dashboards were developed in **Power BI** using the original dataset.
